# Rakuten Reward SDK for iOS

Public releases for Rakuten Reward SDK, iOS version, including CocoaPods and Carthage specs.

## Integration with Xcode projects

Swift frameworks are not necessarily binary compatible across different Xcode versions. Please pay attention to the Xcode version that was used to compile the SDK for iOS.

### via Carthage

Add `Cartfile` to root folder of your Xcode project. In the file, please input the below:

```
binary "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rakuten-Reward-SDK/Reward-SDK-iOS/master/CarthageSpec.json"
```

Run `carthage update` to download the latest version of SDK to `<YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER>/Carthage/iOS`. Drag `RakutenRewardSDK.framework` from this folder to `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` (**DO NOT** drag it to `Embedded Binaries`, it will conflict with `copy-frameworks` script of Carthage).

**NO NEED** enabling `Always embed Swift Standard Libraries` in project `Build Settings` if you're on Swift project.

Finally, use built-in script of Carthage to remove fat binary framework issue for App Store submission (for v9.1.0 and below) 

open `Build Phases` of Xcode project and add `New Run Script Phase`, add a setup as in the image below:
- shell script: `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`
- Input files: `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/RakutenRewardSDK.framework`
- Output files: `$(BUILD_PRODUCT_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORK_FOLDER_PATH)/RakutenRewardSDK.framework`

Adding Reward SDK via CocoaPods require custom `source`, please add to your `Podfile` the spec as below

```ruby
